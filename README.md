# Car-Detection-Using-License-Plate-Recognition

## Project Overview
The "Car Detection Using License Plate Recognition" project aims to develop an automated system for accurately detecting and recognizing car license plates from video footage. This system enhances video frames through preprocessing techniques, identifies potential license plate regions, segments individual characters, and utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to decode license plate numbers.

## Key Features
- **Video Frame Enhancement**: Apply preprocessing techniques to improve image quality for better detection accuracy.
- **License Plate Region Identification**: Detect potential license plate areas within video frames.
- **Character Segmentation**: Isolate individual characters from the identified license plate.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Use TensorFlow for decoding license plate numbers from segmented characters.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Designed for efficient performance to handle real-time video feeds.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks and video frame manipulation.
- **TensorFlow**: For implementing OCR to recognize characters.
- **Python**: For overall system integration and development.

## Challenges
The project addresses several challenges, including:
- Variations in image quality and resolution.
- Different license plate designs across regions.
- Environmental factors affecting video capture (e.g., lighting conditions, angles).
- The need for real-time processing capabilities to ensure timely data capture and recognition.

## Applications
- **Traffic Management**: Enhance monitoring and enforcement of traffic laws.
- **Security**: Support vehicle tracking and identification for security purposes.
- **Data Collection**: Aid in collecting vehicle-related data for urban planning and analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
The project aims to deliver a robust and efficient system capable of high accuracy and real-time performance, contributing to:
- Improved traffic law enforcement.
- Enhanced vehicle monitoring capabilities.
- Valuable insights for urban planning initiatives.
